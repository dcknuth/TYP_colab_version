# Teach Yourself Python - Colab Version
Teach Yourself Python - the Colab version was created to target a nine day, in-person class of 2-hour sessions. It uses Colab to allow students to use any hardware with a web browser. This means they can come with a laptop of their choice or have a system of unknown OS provided by the school.  
Lessons 1-6, 7 and 10 mostly follow the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fautomatetheboringstuff.com%2F)

Lessons are organized as a series of Colab Notebooks. The first notebook points to all the others and can be found here:

[Intro Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jLX1sF2yU-43QqpS5EpwE6gAEA9OCUzPDW6b9UUrRs0) Mostly a repeat of what is in lesson00

The older, longer version targeted for use with the Spider IDE is [here](https://github.com/dcknuth/teach_yourself_python/)
